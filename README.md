# 911-Calls-Kaggle

This is a small project to showcase manipulation, visualization, and feature engineering of 911 call data off a dataset available on Kaggle. I've included small explanations of each step I took and each graph I made.
I show details such as the most common reason for 911 calls, and the time of day and year they most frequently occur
